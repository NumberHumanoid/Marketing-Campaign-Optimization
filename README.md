# Introduction
## Background Context: 
- **(Raw-Campaign-Data)**: contains 2977 rows of insured data, where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured:
  - *Client_ID*: A unique identifier for each client in the dataset
  - *Client_Type*: Represents the type of hospital account (big, medium, small facilities).
  - *Number_of_Customers*: The count of customers associated with each client.
  - *Monthly_Target*: The sales target set for each month, reflecting the goals set for sales teams or marketing campaigns.
  - *Zip_Code*: Geographic identifier used to analyze regional differences in marketing strategy
  - *Calendar_Date*: The date associated with each data entry, allowing for time-series analysis or tracking impact
  - *Amount_Collected*: The total amount of sales collected
  - *Unit_Sold*: The number of units sold
  - *Campaign (Email)*: Marketing Campaign Category via Email
  - *Campaign (Flyer)*: Marketing Campaign Category via Flyers
  - *Campaign (Phone)*: Marketing Campaign Category via Phone
  - *Sales Contact (1-5)*: The different types of sales contacts or interactions tracking sales intensity.
  - *Number of Competition*: The level of competition (e.g., high, low) each client faces, which could significantly influence the effectiveness of different marketing strategies.
 
## Business Objective:
- The project deals with analyzing marketing strategies for hospitals, categorized into small, medium, large, and private facilities. The goal is to identify which marketing tactics (e.g., email, flyers, phone calls, direct sales visits) are most effective for each type of hospital account. 
- This involves understanding organic sales generation and how additional sales can be driven through specific marketing activities. The analysis acknowledges that not all marketing tactics are equally effective across all account types, aiming to tailor strategies to maximize the impact on sales.

  - What is the **impact** of each marketing strategy and sales visit on Sales (Amount_Collected)?
  - Are the same marketing strategies valid for all the different client types?

# Business Data-Driven Insights: 
- **Marketing Strategy Effectiveness Varies by Facility Type:** The data clearly indicates that not all marketing strategies yield the same ROI across different facility types (Small, Medium, Large, Private). This underscores the importance of a more targeted marketing approach that considers the unique characteristics and needs of each facility type.
- **High ROI on Flyers for Medium Facilities:** For medium facilities, flyer campaigns stand out with a significant return on investment (ROI), generating an average of four dollars for every dollar spent. This suggests that traditional marketing channels, such as flyers, can still be highly effective, particularly in certain contexts.
- **For medium facilities, flyer campaigns stand out with a significant return on investment (ROI)**: generating an average of four dollars for every dollar spent. This suggests that traditional marketing channels, such as flyers, can still be highly effective, particularly in certain contexts.
- **Tailored Strategies for Maximum Impact:** The varied effectiveness of different marketing strategies and sales contacts across facility types highlights the need for bespoke marketing plans. Insurance providers should tailor their marketing efforts based on the facility type to maximize impact and efficiency.
- **Potential for Cost Savings:** By identifying underperforming marketing strategies and sales contacts for each facility type, insurance providers can streamline their marketing budgets. For instance, focusing on flyer campaigns for medium facilities while scaling back less effective tactics can optimize marketing spend.
- **Negative Impact of Certain Strategies:** The analysis identified specific strategies, such as Sales Contact 1 and Campaign Phone, underperform or even negatively impact sales in certain contexts. This insight provides an opportunity to reevaluate and potentially discontinue these strategies to reallocate resources more effectively.
- **The Role of Competition:** While not directly analyzed in the presented conclusions, the level of competition each client faces is an important external factor that could influence the effectiveness of different marketing strategies. Future analyses could benefit from incorporating competition data to refine marketing approaches further.
